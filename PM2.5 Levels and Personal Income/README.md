# PM2.5 and Personal Income 

## This was effectively the final project for my graduate data analysis course at Pace University. To briefly sum up what I did, I used an API to grab particulate matter data at the state level to measure its causal effect on personal income per capita at the state level.


## DISCLAIMER: THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT WAS PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY RATHER THAN ECONOMETRIC ACCURACY. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ARE NOT AT ALL CONCLUSIVE, AS THERE IS A LACK OF SOME ESSENTIAL ECONOMETRIC ELEMENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL IN DETERMINING A STUDY TO BE SOUND AND NON-BIASED. THE INCLUSION OF THIS PROJECT ON MY REPO IS PURELY TO DEMONSTRATE PROGRAMMING CAPABILITY AND PARTIALLY THEORETICAL CAPABILITY BEHIND A STUDY, NOT A FINALIZED STUDY.

## Below contains a description of each of the files contained within this project. Most files begin with the 'Ryan Shehata ECO 590 Final' prefix, so this will be excluded from the file titles for each description.

### Presentation
This is the slide deck that is an overview of the research I did and the coding methodologies I had applied within the project.

### Dataset v4
This is the final dataset used in the regression analysis after all data cleaning was complete.

### Jupyter Notebook
This is the full data manipulation notebook that contains all code EXCLUDING the regressions, as this was programmed
on an R Markdown file instead. Start here to see the correct chronological order of my code, and then go to the file
titled 'Regression Markdown'. 

### Regression Markdown
This file contains the regression code as well as the regression table creation. This is the SECOND file to observe
when attempting to view the code in correct chronological order.

### incomealldata
This csv contains the personal income per capita data used within the study for every state. The source is specified
in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Additional Graphs and Tables
These are PNG outputs of graphs created from both the output of both the Python code and the R code. The 3 graphs
can be found within the Jupyter Notebook and the regression table can be found within the Regression Markdown.

I hope you find my work interesting!
