# Hello everyone! My name is Ryan Shehata. 

It is great to meet you. Currently, I am a graduate student at Pace University, in my final semester of the AQEAP program. I am also a data science consulting intern at Management Solutions. 

My goal is to one day become an expert in all things data science, machine learning, and in other emerging technologies that use various coding frameworks. I created this repository not only to familiarize myself with the Github platform, but to also learn from others as to how they utilize  code to make the world a beter place. 

# Some additional things about me... 

I'm highly interested in traveling the world one day, and I would consider making playlists as one of my most time-consuming hobbies. I am a music lover and strive to discover new artists and genres as much as possible. Beyond music, I have an appreciation for all the more creative things in life, including fashion, movies, and art. (Fun fact, I used to make music, teaching myself basic-level piano, guitar, and production software!)
