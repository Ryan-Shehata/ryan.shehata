# Hello everyone! My name is Ryan Shehata. 

I created this repository not only as a space to share some of my academic projects, but to also learn from others how they utilize code to make the world a better place. 

# Some additional things about me... 

I'm highly interested in traveling the world one day, and I would consider making playlists as one of my most time-consuming hobbies. I am a music lover and strive to discover new artists and genres as much as possible. Beyond music, I have an appreciation for all the more creative things in life, including fashion, movies, and art. (Fun fact, I used to make music, teaching myself basic-level piano, guitar, and production software!)
